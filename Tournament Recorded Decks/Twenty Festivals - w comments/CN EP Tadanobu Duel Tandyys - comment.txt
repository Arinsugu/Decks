This is not a rocket deck, this is a daidoji "come and get a piece of me" deck. Your priority, versus military, should be board dominance over fast gain (so basically, ignore your SH ability).
It is very, very, very, VERY, VERY VERY helpful to start your 2nd turn with a 9 gold production, or better. Grow your economy.
You wouldn't imagine how this deck can be expensive (there are 10-20 fate cards that actually expect you to spend money)
The sensei should also not dictate what you do. it's just free, so grab some cards or honor from time to time, is all.
When facing political deck, there's no way you run faster than him. You have to mitigate his gain/loss, that's when you dig for shirarou, soeka, dishonor cards, and BCIs.
Versus dishonor, you want to keep an eye on taking a province from time to time, but bascially, your hope is to live long enough so that you can bring him to -20
