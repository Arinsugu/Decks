This is a control, "once per turn abuse" deck: there are so, so, so many things that allow you to gnaw is ankle, that at some point you will consume him, given time. 
Until then, you will bide your time, and have penty, plenty losing battles : the whole point if to spend wisely your bullets, take these 10 decisions every turn without losing your focus, and know when to let go, when to fight (and lose, but less than him) and when you actually go for something.
Also, when facing a rocket deck, the problem is simply to pray for a smooth dynasty flow, grab your hard counters, and hope it's enough
