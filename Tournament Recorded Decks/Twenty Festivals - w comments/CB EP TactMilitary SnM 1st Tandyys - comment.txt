This is kind of a tower deck : you have big, big guys. You have one of the best printed SH battle action. 
Wait him, get him, smash him. Don't be greedy, don't be too eager. Don't be gun shy either. Be calm, and win.
You are immensely good in opposed battles (plenty red cards, tactician, printed strong) so there's a decent chance "anything you got versus anything I got" will be in your favor. if no now, the next turn. 
You lose if your opponent wins too fast (eg : runs a political rocket), and that where the tacticians shine : anyone of these 6 guys, naked, is a province eater versus most rocket decks. Drop a turn 2 ayameko to a phoenix deck, and watch him freak out.
Versus Militaries : you have high PS, resilient guys, plenty red cards : there are no free "I throw 8F naked at your province" lunches here. Make him sweat a little, make it expensive to him.
